## Tools of Validation

This unit will introduce the various ‘essential’ validation tools as well as various other helpful tools and learning materials to guide new mappers.

#### LearnOSM: Tasking Manager
Hopefully you've seen the [LearnOSM module dedicated to the Tasking Manager](http://learnosm.org/en/coordination/tasking-manager/) by now, please make a quick review; or take some time to go through it if it's your first time.

#### LearnOSM: JOSM - Detailed Editing Section
Validation Activators are expected to be proficient in using the JOSM editor. [The entire section on JOSM in LearnOSM](http://learnosm.org/en/josm/) is relevant to this course and specific modules will be referred to in several lessons.

### JOSM for Validators

The interface for 'validating' on the Tasking Manager is really not validating in itself, it is more for organizing and keeping track; to really validate the mapping and data quality, you need to use JOSM.

#### Tasking Manager Buttons

The <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_Tasking_Manager">OSM Tasking Manager</a> is not a tool for validating data itself, but as a component of the mapping coordination, there is a 'validation' step built into the workflow. There is some <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_Tasking_Manager/Validating_data">general guidance on the 'validation step'</a> of the Tasking Manager on the OpenStreetMap Wiki. The key here is that Validation Activators are both doing due diligence in reviewing the data before validating a task and that they are giving a 'third' review of tasks validated by volunteers. <br><p><br></p>

#### Why JOSM?
No other editor is quite up to the challenge of doing robust data quality and validity checks like JOSM. Designed to facilitate large area, long-term, offline editing with a built in validation feature with the a large community of third-party plug-in developers there is almost no tool for validators that compares.

#### JOSM Validation Feature

By default JOSM should run it's validation function anytime you try to upload data to OpenStreetMap. The OpenStreetMap<a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Validator"> wiki-page on the JOSM Validator</a> explains the types of validation performed. We will return to the the JOSM validator in the next lesson.

#### Helpful JOSM Plug-ins
JOSM Plug-ins are further explored in the LearnOSM: JOSM Plug-ins Module. For validation, these plug-ins come in handy:
* Buildings Plug-in: many times new mappers don't know to square buildings, rather than make them do it all over; with JOSM you can quickly select many building and square them.
* Imagery Offset Db: if you need to see why or if features should be shifted, this is a helpful tool
* Mirrored Download: a must for doing large area validation

#### Other Helpful Tools

There are also many other tools for OpenStreetMap data inspection.

#### Review

It is true that JOSM is the only tool Validation Activators need for the entire validation process.

* True
* False (correct answer)
