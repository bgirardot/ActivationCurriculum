This unit will introduce the various tools/platforms/methods for HOT communication both internally and externally.

### Volunteer and Tech Communities
Published by our partner, the Digital Humanitarian Network, the "Volunteer and Tech Communities" guide is an excellent resource to start thinking about effective communication strategies.

### Basic Communication

This unit will cover the basics of HOT communication, the tools and methods for mostly internal (global HOT community) communications.

<p>HOT has many mailing-lists; there is a master spreadsheet with over 50 
that HOT owns or co-operates/moderates that will be shared with endorsed
 Public Relations Activators. For training purposes these are the most

### Advanced Comms

Now we'll look at 'how' these tools are used, but first a few more tools to know about.

The Activation Lead(s) will typically be the ones who will set up the tools and methods for coordinating among the Activation Team. Due to it being generally related to communications the Public Relations volunteers may be delegated to set-up and/or help maintain team collaboration.
