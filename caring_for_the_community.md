**Items to Review**

If there is one thing you read about the legal responsibilities and risks of contributing as a digital volunteer, this article published by the Wilson Center should be it.

This publication of the Wilson Center, by Edward S. Robson, Esq. reads quick and provides a ton of information regarding the legal risks and protections for digital humanitarians: https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/responding_to_liability_1.pdf

### Legal Risks
The previous unit looked at individual health risks, but there are other risks to community including legal action against the organization or individuals.

**HOT Volunteer Coverage**

So are you or any other HOT volunteers at risk of litigation if something is done wrong during an Activation?
Unfortunately the answer is yes, there is no absolute protection from someone trying to sue you or anyone else as an individual. However, there is little risk to those who are acting reasonably and under the direction of the Activation Protocol as HOT is a registered non-profit corporation and would be the responsible party in the United States. However, outside jurisdictions could allow an individual to sue another individual even if they can prove they were 'doing as they were told'.

**Minimize Personal Risk**

Here are the basics that every individual can do to minimize their own liability:
* Operate within the Activation Protocol and HOT Code of Conduct at all times.
* Actively participate in amending, or at minimum inform your Activation Lead, when policy or guidance is not working with practice.
* Immediately inform the HOT Executive Director of any legal concerns.

### Conflict Resolution
Unfortunately we are sometimes a risk to each other even in good mental and physical health; simple disagreements can lead to some of the same trauma as dealing with disaster if not dealt with quickly and completely.

**When to Intervene**

Debate is a part of the Open Source type community that HOT belongs to. Healthy debate is good, but digital communication can easily be misunderstood and even a well meaning constructive criticism can begin an argument that can damage the entire community. Keeping in mind the signs and dealing individually with people showing signs of disaster stress, the Community Care Activators need to monitor the HOT communication channels and try to intervene before a conflict occurs.

**Resolution Process**
The HOT Community Working Group has drafted a Resolution Process.
Outline:
* Key Messages
* Steps to Normalize/De-escalate
* Actions
* Supporting Items/Questions

If these methods fail, email the Activation Lead with Executive Director copied and inform them of the situation and measures taken in attempt to resolve.
