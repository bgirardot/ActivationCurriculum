**Requesting Imagery**

So how does HOT get imagery if it's not already available from the usual sources?

HOT Imagery Coordination Group: HOT has a group of core imagery experts and partner liaisons that have built a great collaboration with a variety of imagery providers. As an Imagery Activator, you might not be invited to discussions until you have built up some trust with the imagery coordination group, however you may be assisting with identifying the bounds of the area of interest and need to know the basics of the request process.

**Request Process**

At the time this lesson was built, HOT was still drafting a more robust Imagery Request process, currently there is a short [process outlined in the Activation wiki-page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/HOT_activation#Imagery_Coordination).
